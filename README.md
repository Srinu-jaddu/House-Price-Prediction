# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices using a regression model. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries and tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predicting house prices based on various features and attributes.
- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset containing information about houses, including features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and more.
- **Model**: The project employs a linear regression model for house price prediction.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinu-jaddu/House-Price-Prediction.git
cd House-Price-Prediction
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Run the main script to train the house price prediction model:

```bash
python train.py
```

2. Evaluate the model and make predictions:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

3. Use the trained model for predictions in your own application.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the `data/` directory. You can find details about the dataset and its features in the data documentation.

## Model Details

The machine learning model used in this project is a simple linear regression model. The implementation can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Results

After running the training and evaluation scripts, you will get insights into the model's performance, including metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
